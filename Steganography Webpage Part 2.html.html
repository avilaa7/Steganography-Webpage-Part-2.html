
<h3><i>Steganography Hidden Within Sound</i></h3>
<p>
Steganography through audio and video are more complicated examples of data encryption. Audio steganography involves the embedding of information inside audio files, which can be done in various ways. A primary example of this method is the slight change of the audio frequency, which aids in hiding audio information to ensure the recording has not been tampered with or can be heard by anyone. This is an effective method of hiding information, as the audio signal change is <b>imperceptible</b> to human ears. By carefully adjusting the frequency of the audio back to its original state, the concealed message can then be revealed. </p>

<h3><i>Hidden Visuals in Video Steganography</i></h3>
<p>
Shifting focus to video steganography, LSB Insertion is utilized in one method as well. Through a videoâ€™s frames, data can be inserted by modifying either the pixel values or color channels. These alterations can not be distinguished by average viewers and therefore must be slowed down and decoded by its recipient. This method of steganography is also used to avoid any tampering and unwanted eyes to view the recording. </p>

<h3><i>File Steganography and Its Importance</i></h3>
<p>
The method of file steganography is another way to hide significant data or messages. By embedding data in numerous file types, which include images, audio, video or document files, information can be concealed without modifying the general makeup and function of the file. To someone unfamiliar with these file types, they may appear as regular files. Through the use of steganography, unused areas within the files are inserted with concealed data. Only a person familiar with a decoding method will be able to access the knowledge held within the file. Similar to the other methods of masking data within normal-looking objects, file steganography effectively transmits this information while also appearing as a regular file.</p>
